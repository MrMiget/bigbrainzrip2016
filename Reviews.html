However, this does seem to be helpful in a creative  way, educating my identical twin boys on basic multiplication facts, which is a  necessary educational ingredient!</span><br />

                  <p class="text"><span class="textBlack">I've spent the past six months going over the multiplication  facts with my eight year old. I mean every night getting out the flash cards,  having her write them down a bazillion times, etc. You name it we've tried it. <br />
  So my mom found this &quot;game&quot; on the internet called  Timez Attack. At first I thought, &quot;Yeah right, she's not gonna be  interested in this game.&quot; My kids are used to the high tech graphics of  the Nintendo and Playstation games. My mom kept prodding me to look into the  site further. <br />
  <br />
  So last night I decided to go check it out. The graphics  were very good and the concept sounded intriguing. &nbsp;It's actually similar  to some of the video games that they play. You have to make your way through  this dungeon and fight &quot;monsters&quot; which have the multiplication  tables on the front of them. I got wrapped up in the game and watched her for  three hours. <br />
  <br />
                    She didn't want to go to bed last night because she wanted  to try to beat one more level. This morning she woke up two hours before school  and started to play this game! I can't believe it but the multiplication facts  are actually staying with her. <br />
                    <br />
                    I'm usually skeptical about these kinds of games because we  have a whole cabinet full of educational games that rarely get played but I'm  sold on this one.</span><br />

                  <p class="text"><span class="textBlack">My son and I were struggling to master his times tables,  despite lots of practice. &nbsp;I was getting worried because he was getting  ready to go into 4th grade and I knew this was important. &nbsp;I found your  program at the homeschooling convention they had downtown Phoenix.  &nbsp;I thought it was so funny that there were no adults at the booth but  about six kids my son&rsquo;s age fighting over who would get to play next &ndash; a very  good sign! &nbsp;<br />
                      <br />
                      I took a post card from the table and loaded the trial  version for my son when I got home that night. &nbsp;Within minutes he was  begging us to buy the full download and even offered to use his allowance money  to do it!&nbsp; We bought the download (I&rsquo;m not crazy) and by the next day he  was spitting out his times tables like he&rsquo;d known them forever, and quickly  too! &nbsp;Since then he&rsquo;s played the game for at least an hour a day, and  still loves it almost as much as his Playstation games!</span><br />

                    &quot;It is one of the best games ever!&nbsp; Now I know  what 6x3 is, it's 18 and I was stuck on that one for a long time.&nbsp; So  thanks for helping me on this! My favorite part is the dragon level, where when you get a  dragon egg it gets you health.&nbsp; I also like when the ogre scratches his  tush!&nbsp; I also love the game because it has great graphics.&nbsp; I will  tell my friends about it if they need help with multiplication!&quot;</span><br />

  never get it, was helping her younger sister and realized  she knew one of the tables.&nbsp; &quot;I did  it,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;I knew them  all and I didn't even realize it.&quot;&nbsp; This  game works.&nbsp; Thank-you, it answered my  prayers.</span><br />
