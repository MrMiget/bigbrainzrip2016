		<description><![CDATA[M Ward,

Great questions and comments. Other folks have had a similar perception, and I&#039;m grateful for the chance to address them:

1. &quot;It makes me start all over again when I fail something!&quot; A small error does not restart a whole level. If a student misses one fact, they review one fact. That&#039;s it. But we don&#039;t want ANY student to even FEEL like that&#039;s happening, so let&#039;s break down what&#039;s actually taking place.

If a student is fluent with a fact, they will &quot;know&quot; the answer in less than 1 - 2 seconds, allowing them plenty of time to accurately input the answer. But if a student is only partially fluent, it will take them a while to &quot;remember&quot; the answer, forcing them to rush to input the answer, and leaving them much more likely to make a typing mistake. 

In that scenario they&#039;re clearly not fluent, but they may FEEL like they knew the answer and are being unfairly punished for a simple typing error, but the reality is that their mastery is still developing. Timez Attack very good at judging between a typing error and a lack of mastery.

But even in the case of a pure typing error, the program will simply review the &quot;missed&quot; fact and bring them right back. As part of the review, the missed fact will be integrated and tested along with other facts because reviewing just one fact is a completely short-term exercise and doesn&#039;t actually develop memorization. But even that review is not wasted because while reviewing that fact, we&#039;re also reinforcing any other facts that are borderline.

Mastering all the facts is deeply challenging. Only 12% of students master it by 5th-grade. Even after 24 to 30 hours of teacher instruction, the average student only masters 59% of their facts nationwide. I suppose it makes sense that some students would get a bit frustrated while working their way towards such a vital accomplishment, but we&#039;re doing everything we can to remove even the smallest obstacles for students, so thank you for raising the discussion point. If even one student is hitting a stumbling-block, we need to improve.

#2 &quot;Just drill-and-kill.&quot; This is a curiously derogatory term. Comprehension needs to come before Fluency. But fluency with basic facts will greatly enhance future comprehension of higher-order facts. For example, an educator recently told us that they only want students to memorize facts up to the 5x5 because for 7 x 5 they can simply pull up 2 x 5 and 5 x 5 and then add them together. Well, you CAN do that, but you&#039;re going to be able to learn higher-order concepts much more efficiently if you don&#039;t HAVE to constantly interrupt the learning process to stop and make basic calculations. Successful students need both comprehension AND fluency. To steal a silly sports metaphor, a football player needs to know the offense, and he CAN just hop on one leg, but he&#039;ll be vastly more effective running on both legs. Fluency with single digit facts really needs to be a bare minimum. Kids need to know the alphabet and they need to know their basic facts.

#3. &quot;There is no time for any conceptual thinking. It&#039;s strictly memorization.&quot; Actually, we do a pretty cool job of the conceptual side. For example, 4 + 6 shows 4 balls and six balls, then shows them joining together to add up to 10. Then we reverse-engineer that into fact families of 10 - 4 = 6, starting with 10 balls and subtracting 6 balls from it, etc.

Now, we very quickly get to a point where we ARE focused on recall and that is absolutely the emphasis of the program. You&#039;re entirely right that we are supplemental at this point.

I&#039;ll also throw out that we LOVE to improve and are working furiously on some very cool enhancements for addition.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would like to thank you for teaching my 4-year-old multiplication in May of 2011.  I just gave him the free game and the multiplication table and he learned the facts.  As a reward, I eventually upgraded the game and we have never been the same.  We are planning to get your other games, because your product is just so much fun and it is an education at best.  I am convinced that learning and practicing math facts with TimezAttack develops and ensures solid math skills that will take one a long way into an academic and professional success.  Our gratitude to the TimezAttack team is immeasurable.]]></description>
