		<description><![CDATA[My oldest son really enjoys Timez Attack Multiplication. I was telling my brother that we were using the software as a supplement to our Math curriculum and he seemed that to disapprove. However, he watched my son play it for a while and was very impressed with both the graphics and play aspect, as well as the educational value in the software. We are eagerly waiting on the Addition and subtraction software for my younger son. When will it be available?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know who this educator was but he obviously is not a good teacher of students with  Dyslexia, or any other special learning needs.  My son&#039;s attention span and progress has improved greatly and he has now moved from the bottom of his class to the top of his class after just 6 months of using this program.  Instead of demanding that he sit down to do math, he enjoys it and spends hours on this program without any arguing or fussing to do math homework.

Thank you so much.  This program is amazing, and you have made our home life much more peaceful.

When will the Addition and Subtraction programs be done? - My son has been asking about them now that it is past Christmas 2011.
Also , do you know of any programs like this for spelling?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have found your software while navigating on the web and immediately bought it, three years ago. My - then - 3rd grade son really liked it and we began a campaign in school for other kids and the school to buy the license. We have now purchased your newest version, and my younger son is also enjoying Timez. 
Kids have access to IPads, computers, Wii, Playstation... And all the books, the good tv shows, travelling... If teachers and schools don&#039;t keep up, classes will certainly seem very boring. 
I have 2 suggestions. 
1 - consider translating. We live in Brazil. Despite the fact that most of the game can be understood when it comes to numbers, it would be really nice and a greater stimulus. 
2 - in the same age / grade group, the kids are working on writing. In Brazil, as in many other countries, 2nd and 3rd grade are when kids learn and practice writing cursive. Recent technology has made us all debate if we should teach writing in different manners and what those modes should be. I do believe we must include in this literacy project the ability to handle typing. Consider an interesting game where kids would learn how to type...!
Congratulations!
I wish you all the best.

		<description><![CDATA[I appreciate Big Brainz&#039;s effort to create such great educational products. I think more companies should be putting ed software together like this for basic skills across the curriculum. As a teacher, I believe that having good and entertaining software for children is critical for today&#039;s standards. I can spend more time teaching critical thinking and problem solving in the classroom, if I&#039;m not using up my time reviewing facts, which kids should know. 

You are leading the industry in this category. I hope that through your marketing, you are finding great success!

I have a few suggestions:

1) Think about making products for other basic skills in other subject areas, like vocabulary, spelling, geography, historical dates &amp; facts, scientific elements, etc.
2) Make the product flexible so that teachers could load a bank from a self-created txt or doc file to create their own &quot;game&quot; for their students. (There&#039;s a Jeopardy game console that can be found in ed catalogs that has that capability. Your product should too.)
3) Make a space on your website that allows teachers and parents to upload these self-created banks and make those available for free on your website. (This follows a model similar to Geometer&#039;s SketchPad.)

Again, thank you. Peace and best of luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are not kidding. As a math teacher, it makes me mad when I&#039;m told to use the ActivStudio software to &quot;create&quot; engaging activities for my 8th graders! THEY have got to be kidding. There is no way that thrown together activities mimicking video games is going to &quot;engage&quot; any student. Hire the folks who know how to do it!!!!! Pay them well!!! License it for my campus. 

Educators tend to think that if they have a computer, they can do it. Hah! In my previous career, I was a graphic artist. I hear, &quot;Ohh, I&#039;ve got to spend a little more time to make my presentations look as good as yours.&quot;  Sure, take four years of college fine arts and graphics,  spend a kazillion hours learning multiple software applications, invest about 6 or 7 years working in the field, and you can do it like mine easy. Duh.  Your stuff is great. Keep it coming!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a total no brainer.  Our kids are very tech savvy, why would we think that pong style software would cut the mustard?  They&#039;ll be bored in 2 minutes straight.  Our 6yo is rapt with your multiplication program - we could do with the + and - programs before Christmas though ;-)  I found you through Mr Pai and think he is totally hitting the nail on the head with education.  Connection and good quality games is the way forward for education - particularly for boys..... and boys have the biggest problems both here (UK) and in the US.  Keep up the good work, your games are fab.  Fiona]]></description>
