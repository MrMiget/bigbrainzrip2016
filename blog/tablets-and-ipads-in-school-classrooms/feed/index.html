		<description><![CDATA[Yes, we do hope you will make an Android version for tablets.  We have loved Timez Attack for a long time, and are loving the new division and add/sub versions too.  You guys are amazing, and we are so grateful for all your hard work.
We look forward to one day using your programs on our android tablets.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking as a parent of two special needs kids - the concept of doing math without a person hanging over them putting on the pressure is amazing! My daughter can simply not do math but TimezATtack has really helped and now she is 3 grades ahead in multiplication over her addition and subtraction (so I can&#039;t wait for those to come out!) My son started doing Timezattack (he is 7) and it really helped him jump way ahead in his addition and subtraction... For some reason kids with special needs really do learn better on computers and with technology. It takes away the whole anxiety component which is so destructive to learning-- the more technology the better as far as I am concerned.]]></description>
