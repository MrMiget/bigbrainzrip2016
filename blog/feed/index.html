<p><a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/">Big Brainz</a> is perfect for helping children who learn in different ways and at varying speeds to finally understand math. Big Brainz makes learning math fun. Kids will be more willing to learn, and will have a better chance of understanding and remembering math when they learn it from a game as opposed to worksheets and books.</p>
<p>Big Brainz math games like <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Multiplication.php">Timez Attack</a> are meant to boost a child’s skills in times tables up to complete fluency. Teachers, you can use time at school to have your students play this game. The kids will think of it as playtime, but they’ll be learning more efficiently than they would in an ordinary lesson. Instead of dreading math, kids will look forward to it because they can learn multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction by playing video games.</p>
<p>Parents can also have their kids play these games at home, because Big Brainz games are online. Your student or child will feel more confident in school with their math skills advancing so greatly.</p>
<p>Try a <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Downloads.html">demo</a> of our math games online for free to see if you think they are right for your students or children. We recommend setting aside ten total hours to complete the entire game, but most students will finish even faster than that. Instead of letting kids fall behind in the regular school system, which must move ahead in its teaching schedule whether or not every student is caught up, let students play Big Brainz. Rather than spending 30+ hours learning from worksheets, math books, and homework assignments, most Big Brainz students are fluent within a few hours.</p>
<p>Forget the bad reputation of video games, and have students learn more efficiently with Timez Attack and other math games from <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/">Big Brainz</a>.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com">Big Brainz</a>, we know that “fun” and “math” don’t necessarily go hand-in-hand. This can make learning basic math concepts a little difficult sometimes. However, we also know how important these basic math skills are––so we created a list of super fun math games to help your kids learn subtraction, addition, division, and multiplication.</p>
<p><strong><br />
<b>Beach Ball Addition</b></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ioIr3Wm.png" alt="beach ball addition math game" width="150" height="150"></p>
<p><em>Supplies:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Beach ball</li>
<li>Permanent marker</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>
<p>Label a beach ball with numbers 1-12 (make sure to repeat numbers for practice adding doubles). Have your children toss the ball to each other. Before they can pass it on to the next person, they simply add whatever numbers are under their hands after they catch it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Subtraction “War”</b><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/GYu4CV1.jpg" width=300" height="200" alt="deck of cards for the math game subtraction war"><br />
<br />
<em>Supplies needed:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Deck of cards</li>
<li>Kitchen Timer</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>
<p>Deal out the cards, giving each player an equal amount until the deck runs out. Make sure to keep all of the cards in a stack. Don’t peek! Each face card is worth 10 points, while an ace is worth 1 point. Set the timer for 10-15 minutes. Each player turns two cards face up, and turns those numbers into a subtraction problem. For example, if your child drew a 6 and a 4, he or she would say “6-4=2” and if you drew a 7 and a 6, you would say “7-6=1.” If your child had the higher number, he or she would win the cards and put them at the bottom of his or her stack. If two players come up with the same answer, the two will “go to war.” In this case, each player lays out four cards, two face down and two face up. Instead of doing a subtraction problem this time, the players will do an addition problem. Whoever has the highest answer wins all 8 cards. Once the timer goes off, the person with the most cards in his or her stack wins!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><b>Multiplication Jenga</b></strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/dqL0o7A.png" alt="multiplication sign" width="220" height="194"><br />
<em>Supplies needed:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Jenga set</li>
<li>Tape</li>
<li>Markers</li>
<li>Paper</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>
<p>Write out one multiplication problem for each block on separate pieces of paper. Cut out the multiplication problems and tape them to each block. Set up the pieces as normal, and make sure each problem is hidden from sight. The game is played just like the normal version, but if a child successfully pulls one of the blocks out of the stack, he or she must answer the problem written on the block.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Division Leftovers</b><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ocgmd8H.jpg" alt="colorful beads for the math game division leftovers" width="250" height="188"></p>
<p><em>Supplies needed:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>15-50 beads per group of 2</li>
<li>A pair of dice per group of 2</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>
<p>Choose the number of beads you want each group to have. The larger the number, the longer the game takes. Player one will roll the dice. Say you’ve given the group 35 beads, and the student rolls a 3. The student will then see how many groups of 3 he or she can make out of the 35. The player keeps however many beads are leftover as points. In this example, there would be 2 beads left over, so that player would receive two points. The next player would repeat the above steps, only this time, he or she would divide into 33, since the first player kept 2 beads of the 35 as points. The game continues like this until a player rolls a number higher than the number of beads left. The person with the most points, or beads, at the end of the game wins.</p>
<p>At Big Brainz, we know that adding fun into math can make all the difference in a child’s learning.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Math can be one of the most frustrating subjects you can ever learn. At an early age, we go to school and learn how to add, subtract, divide, and multiply. As adults, it seems simple enough because the older we get, the easier it is for us to comprehend. Unfortunately, it’s not always so simple for kids. Each child goes at his or her own pace and has different ways of learning. Some children learn to add by counting on their fingers or by creating a song to help them with their times tables. Since each child has a different method of learning, it can be difficult to know the best way to teach basic addition and subtraction skills. Teaching them multiplication can be even harder.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.thrive4kids.ca/times-tables-chart-greyscale.png" alt="learning times tables" align="left" hspace="100" />Video games have been around for quite a while now and are very popular among youth. Video games often have a bad connotation as they seem to have some connection with kids harboring laziness and other undesirable traits. Despite the bad rap video games often receive, research is continually being done to see how they can be used in a more positive way, including for educational purposes.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://bigbrainz.com/">Big Brainz</a> has come up with a fun way for kids to learn multiplication. Big Brainz has created a math video game that has produced some amazing results, increasing students’ mathematical knowledge. The new game is called <a href="https://youtu.be/ud4lQC39pn0">Timez Attack</a>.</p>
<p><strong><strong> <img src="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Assets/Images/TALogo3_210Normal.jpg" alt="big brainz timez attach" align="right" /></strong></strong></p>
<p>Timez Attack is an adventure game that takes the player through multiple worlds by solving multiplication problems. Big Brainz claims that this educational game not only helps kids learn multiplication facts but also helps them become fluent in math fundamentals. Check out their <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Schools.php#Research">research</a> to see just how much Timez Attack can help your child become fluent with multiplication. Big Brainz is confident that using their software will be both fun and effective, and they offer great prices.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s face it—not many kids are interested in reciting their multiplication tables when they’ve got video games to play, TV to watch, and technology to explore. Realizing this problem, <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/">Big Brainz</a> created a solution that blends what your kids like doing with the things they need to learn, and it has proven to be successful in multiple trials.</p>
<p>Enter Timez Attack, a math video game designed by Big Brainz to provide students with a learning option that they can actually enjoy. Our model is simple—unlike the majority of educational video games, Timez Attack focuses on providing a successful learning experience AND a great gaming experience, so students win on both fronts.</p>
<div align="center">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ud4lQC39pn0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
</div>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Schools.php#Research">results of Timez Attack</a> are simple but telling. After the required 1-10 hours of gameplay, 95% of students become fluent in the needed math skills for their grade, and average test scores increase by up to 65% following completion. While it takes an average of 15-30 hours to achieve math fluency using worksheets or 2D video games, it takes a maximum of 10 hours with Timez Attack, and with better results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six in every ten Americans report having difficulty solving some type of math, and 30% of Americans say they would rather clean the bathroom than solve a math problem. Yet 93% of Americans say that developing good math skills is crucial to having a successful life. So why do we hate math so much if it brings us success? Maybe it’s because we think it’s hard, or maybe it’s because we are afraid of not being able to understand it. Maybe we didn’t learn all of the fundamentals in math. Whatever the reason, we cannot deny the importance of mathematics. It’s used in our everyday life!</p>
<p>Times tables are one of the earliest math problems we learn as children, and these basic math skills are key to understanding all math. It builds an important foundation for learning different kinds of math like long multiplication, division, algebra, and even fractions. If you don’t know your times tables, it’s difficult to move on to different levels of math.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Hexadecimal_multiplication_table.svg" alt="learning times tables" width="500" height="500">
</div>
<p>Multiplication is used in our everyday lives as well, whether we like it or not. We use it to double recipes, to compare prices and discounts at the grocery store, to keep track of our family budgets, and even to split the bill at a restaurant. We use it on a daily basis and always will. Sure, we could use a calculator for these daily tasks, but who wants to pull one of those out while you’re at the grocery store? You could also get so dependent on a calculator that you lose the knowledge of adding up simple sums.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/">Big Brainz</a> knows the importance of learning your core math skills. The key to learning the core is fluency and memorization, and with their <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Store.php">programs</a> they teach children to memorize math fundamentals so they can continue forward with confidence.</p>
<p>Learning math can be difficult and hard to understand at times, so create a game out of it to make it more fun! Practicing times table games will build that foundation to help you move ahead. Take the time to learn these fundamentals, and it will give you more success in your life and more success with math.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning multiplication tables can be tough for children, and many struggle with grasping these concepts quickly. Students are more likely to pick up these skills by practicing and playing games that test their knowledge rather than simply doing math homework. Here are 5 ways to help your child memorize his or her multiplication times tables:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Bottle Cap Multiplication</b></b></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-I7iiujMUlMM/TsLoGahk2SI/AAAAAAAAAPo/XVSk0PWsIyY/s640/DSC08915.JPG" alt="bottle cap multiplication game" width"300" height="225"></p>
<p>Write the times table equation on the top of a bottle cap and write the answer on the inside of the cap. Once the child answers the question correctly he or she can turn the bottle cap over. Time your child and see how quickly they can flip all the caps over, or see how many caps they can flip over within an allotted time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Sing The Multiplication Tables</b></b></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MYSVWje.png" alt="colorful music notes" width"300" height="224"></p>
<p>Memorizing song lyrics can be an easy way to learn. There are many videos online with free multiplication songs for your child to listen to and memorize. If those songs aren’t catchy enough for you, try singing the multiplication tables to the tune of your child&#8217;s favorite song.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Make Flashcards With Your Favorite Theme</b></b></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://cdn1.moneysavingmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Free-Frozen-themed-Multiplication-Flash-Cards.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="frozen themed multiplication flashcards"></p>
<p>Flashcards are always a helpful trick for memorizing multiplication times tables. But boring flashcards are old news. Print off or draw your own flashcards with your child&#8217;s favorite theme, like <a href="http://moneysavingmom.com/2014/04/free-frozen-themed-multiplication-flash-cards.html"><i>Frozen</i></a> or <i>Star Wars</i>. Learning is always more fun with a friendly face on the flashcard.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Reward System</b></b></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Soapbubbles-SteveEF.jpg" alt="children playing outside" width="300" height="255"></p>
<p>Offering a prize for doing math is always sure to gain a child’s attention. Try giving small rewards for every set of multiplication that they learn. It doesn’t have to be a reward of candy or desserts; it can be something as simple as extra TV time or more free time outside to play.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Timez Attack Video Game</b></b></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Assets/Images/TALogo3_210Normal.jpg" alt="timez attack on big brainz"></p>
<p>Let’s be real here, video games and television are what this generation is interested in. Our <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/online/select_school.php">Timez Attack</a> video game is a high-end math-packed video game sure to entertain your children for hours, and it even ensures mastery of their times tables while playing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m intrigued by the negative responses to the Common Core standards. The opposition is so passionate that often their arguments explode in a flaming ball of general vitriol that makes it hard to see what specific aspects they&#8217;re opposed to. So, in an attempt to engender productive discussion, here here is my attempt to present Common Core concerns simply and clearly.</p>
<p>Inherent in my approach is the assumption that in the grand scheme of things everyone&#8217;s actually on the same side&#8211;the kids&#8217; side. And our kids will be better served when everyone stops fighting and instead works together productively to find common ground. (pardon the pun and cue the sappy music for group hug)</p>
<p>Please jump in to clarify or add concerns, and I will edit accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Undermines Freedom</strong><br />
Many folks see the standards as federal control and they hate being constrained and dictated to by The Man.</p>
<p><strong>Poor Implementation</strong><br />
In many cases, efforts to address the standards have been inept or offensive.</p>
<p><strong>Inflexible</strong><br />
The standards are too high for struggling students or populations, so individual states, districts, and schools would like more flexibility to lower them. Others think the standards are too low.</p>
<p><strong>Testing Pressure</strong><br />
Clear cut standards could create greater pressure on performance. This pressure could tempt teachers to try &#8220;teaching to the test,&#8221; even though such methods generate worse test results<a href="http://www.readingrockets.org/article/teach-test-just-say-no" target="_blank">*</a>. Performance pressure could also prompt additional testing throughout the year, which would detract from instructional time.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><br />
The standards were not created in an ideal way, using ANSI guidelines for example. It&#8217;s costly to implement new standards. They might track too much information about students.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every once in a while I encounter a savvy educator who is opposed to memorizing math facts&#8211;or at least they appear to be. Just today I saw a fearful article that exclaimed &#8220;Memorization Can Inhibit Fluency&#8221; and &#8220;Memorization . . . can be damaging.&#8221; Such educators are doing a wonderful job of championing critical math skills such as number sense, comprehension, and problem-solving, but by attacking the vital skill of automaticity, they&#8217;re unwittingly undermining the very processes they intend to champion.</p>
<p><strong>The Punchline</strong><br />
Before I go any further, let me jump to the punchline. Because I know that if you&#8217;re one of these educators, you&#8217;re already getting ready to give me your very passionate point of view. So . . . if as an educator you have a negativity towards memorization, I would suggest that it&#8217;s because you haven&#8217;t seen it done well. [It can also be that you&#8217;re mostly opposed to memorized process instruction, and in your enthusiasm you lump in all memorization. If so, please read on.]</p>
<p>When done brilliantly, core fact memorization is wildly beneficial. So my call to action is this&#8211;run a simple experiment with Big Brainz. Run some kids through our program. All the way through our program. Then measure the impact on number sense over the next year. I can guarantee the comprehension and application of those kids will skyrocket because I see it happen every single day with every student who runs through our program.</p>
<p>It permanently accelerates comprehension and problem-solving development by freeing up working memory. It improves number sense! It reduces pressure and catapults confidence. The kids love it. Oh, and it actually delivers automaticity&#8211;every time.</p>
<p>Again, until you put us to the test it&#8217;s likely you will be defensive and won&#8217;t really see anything I&#8217;m saying. So seriously, please put us to the test.</p>
<p><strong>Dribbling</strong><br />
Now getting back to how negativity towards memorization undermines overall math success. Imagine a basketball coach telling his team, &#8220;To win games you need great defense and shooting&#8211;so stop learning how to dribble and pass.&#8221; That would make no sense. Great ball-handling only helps everything else you want to do in basketball, and automaticity only helps comprehension and problem-solving.</p>
<p>Sidenote: Just like in math, a basketball player absolutely needs to progress as quickly as possible from static dribbling drills to dynamic dribbling drills. And even static dribbling drills should be motivational and productive. But showering players with negativity towards drilling in general is going to undermine the overall skill, handicapping all their future success because they&#8217;ll constantly have to be thinking and looking at the ball, rather than their teammates or the hoop.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Research</strong><br />
NCTM, TEKS, Common Core, and The National Mathematics Advisory Panel, all agree that &#8220;<a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/report/final-report.pdf#page=47">curriculum must simultaneously</a> <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/report/final-report.pdf#page=47">develop conceptual understanding, computational fluency, and problem-solving </a><a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/report/final-report.pdf#page=47">skills</a>,&#8221; further clarifying that computational fluency means &#8220;<a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/report/final-report.pdf#page=14">automatic (i.e., quick</a> <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/report/final-report.pdf#page=14">and effortless) recall of facts</a>.&#8221; That&#8217;s memorization.</p>
<p>Furthermore, that same Final Report specifies that arguing about the relative merits of these different facets of math is &#8220;misguided&#8221; because &#8220;these capabilities are mutually supportive, each facilitating learning of the others.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Memorization Accelerates Comprehension and Problem-Solving</strong><br />
Students need number sense, comprehension, and application, and a child who enters fourth grade already automatic with core math facts is going to be able to develop these math concepts FASTER than a student who doesn&#8217;t. They will be more confident, but they will also have more available working memory.</p>
<p>Our own research confirms that memorization accelerates comprehension and problem-solving. Specifically, giving student populations the gift of automaticity catapults their year-end math scores. Fluency accelerates overall math learning because once they&#8217;re fluent, students permanently have more available working memory with which to learn new concepts and applications. If you&#8217;re going to chop down trees all day, please take a few minutes to sharpen the ax.</p>
<p><strong>Pressure<br />
</strong>I heard one educator lament that pressure can impede working memory so when a student most needs to recall a fact, they can&#8217;t and then they&#8217;re stuck. This misses the point. If the fact had been actually memorized, it wouldn&#8217;t have needed working memory. It would be effortless and automatic, even under duress. When core facts become trusted friends rather than distant memories, they are always available to help diminish stress AND free up precious working memory.</p>
<p>Of course they still need comprehension and application skills as well. They need all three.</p>
<p><strong>Robots<br />
</strong>I&#8217;ve heard some educators express concern that rote memorization is creating robots and therefore impeding the development of number sense. Not true. Phrases like &#8220;robots&#8221; and &#8220;drill and kill&#8221; have a nice, scary ring to them, but they imply a false principle. Mastering core skills does not in any way inhibit or undermine higher-order thinking. Quite the opposite, it liberates it. Freeing up working memory absolutely helps students be more successful at conceptual understanding and problem-solving. We&#8217;ve run tests where students master multiplication before learning ANY comprehension, and they still do significantly better when they are taught the comprehension.</p>
<p><strong>Pressure<br />
</strong>I&#8217;ve heard some educators complain that the pressure of memorization can give students a bad experience. So stop doing it badly and start doing it well! It&#8217;s not memorization that creates bad experiences any more than math instruction in general creates bad experiences. It&#8217;s bad instruction and bad memorization that create bad experiences. And be very aware that the frustration kids feel when they have to stop and think about every single basic calculation they encounter is always significant. You don&#8217;t remove that frustration simply by telling them it&#8217;s OK.</p>
<p><strong>Common Core Emphasis<br />
</strong>I&#8217;ve heard passionate educators exclaim that Common Core raises the priority of comprehension and application while lowering the emphasis on memorization. Absolutely false. Common Core significantly raised the priority of memorization, bumping it an entire grade earlier AND increasing the specificity of recalling facts &#8220;from memory.&#8221; Now, they ALSO raised and clarified the priority of comprehension and application . . . because all three are necessary and mutually beneficial.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Mutually Supportive<br />
</b></span>Once again, successful math students &#8220;must <strong>simultaneously</strong> develop conceptual understanding, computational fluency, <strong>and</strong> problem-solving skills.&#8221; &#8220;Debates regarding the relative importance of these aspects of mathematical knowledge are misguided&#8221; because &#8220;these capabilities are <strong>mutually supportive, each facilitating learning of the others.</strong>&#8221; [Final Report, 2008 emphasis added]</p>
<p><strong>Organic Automaticity<br />
</strong>Educators with a wonderful and valuable passion for number sense often express that the best way to develop automaticity is to simply use the facts regularly, combined with solid comprehension. I really like the sound of that, and I really wish it were true. But it&#8217;s not. It doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve worked with millions of students, and the majority of them will never develop automaticity with their core facts simply through continued usage and exposure. Some students will. And all students will master some. But most students at some point will need to buckle down and focus to become automatic with just their single digit facts.</p>
<p>However, they CAN acquire this precious skill in a matter of hours&#8211;at least with Big Brainz they can. EVERY student on earth should be given the precious few hours needed to acquire this precious skill and permanently expand their mathematical working memory.</p>
<p><strong>Ineffective Memorization</strong><br />
Wrapping up, let me also point out that it CAN be perfectly accurate to rant and rave against memorization IF you get just a bit more specific. Rant and rave against ineffective memorization&#8211;techniques that generate a negative experience and/or don&#8217;t actually generate fluency (which is most of them). Blast these traditional methods out of the water.</p>
<p><strong>Process Memorization<br />
</strong>You&#8217;re also welcome to rail against step-by-step process instruction that less effective teachers often fall into.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Change or Undermine Common Core or TEKS Requirement</strong><br />
But at the same time be very careful not to undermine the critical skill of automaticity. Be true to all the research behind the very specific common core requirement: &#8220;by the end of Grade 3, know from memory all products of two one-digit numbers.&#8221; Don&#8217;t undermine or change this requirement. And don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s importance is small just because it can be written concisely. The best scientific research in the world found that the #1 &#8220;Critical Foundation for Algebra&#8221; is whole-number fluency, the automatic and effortless recall of core facts, because it frees up working memory to focus on higher-order concepts and application. Give this precious gift to every single student.</p>
<p><strong>Sharpen the Saw<br />
</strong>Your students are going to be chopping away at comprehension and problem-solving 180 hours a year, every year. Give them the few hours needed (and a sufficiently powerful fluency program) to permanently sharpen their saw.</p>
