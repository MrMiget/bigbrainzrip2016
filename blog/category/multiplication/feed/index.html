				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every once in a while I encounter a savvy educator who is opposed to memorizing math facts&#8211;or at least they appear to be. Just today I saw a fearful article that exclaimed &#8220;Memorization Can Inhibit Fluency&#8221; and &#8220;Memorization . . . can be damaging.&#8221; Such educators are doing a wonderful job of championing critical math skills such as number sense, comprehension, and problem-solving, but by attacking the vital skill of automaticity, they&#8217;re unwittingly undermining the very processes they intend to champion.</p>
<p><strong>The Punchline</strong><br />
Before I go any further, let me jump to the punchline. Because I know that if you&#8217;re one of these educators, you&#8217;re already getting ready to give me your very passionate point of view. So . . . if as an educator you have a negativity towards memorization, I would suggest that it&#8217;s because you haven&#8217;t seen it done well. [It can also be that you're mostly opposed to memorized process instruction, and in your enthusiasm you lump in all memorization. If so, please read on.]</p>
<p>When done brilliantly, core fact memorization is wildly beneficial. So my call to action is this&#8211;run a simple experiment with Big Brainz. Run some kids through our program. All the way through our program. Then measure the impact on number sense over the next year. I can guarantee the comprehension and application of those kids will skyrocket because I see it happen every single day with every student who runs through our program.</p>
<p>It permanently accelerates comprehension and problem-solving development by freeing up working memory. It improves number sense! It reduces pressure and catapults confidence. The kids love it. Oh, and it actually delivers automaticity&#8211;every time.</p>
<p>Again, until you put us to the test it&#8217;s likely you will be defensive and won&#8217;t really see anything I&#8217;m saying. So seriously, please put us to the test.</p>
<p><strong>Dribbling</strong><br />
Now getting back to how negativity towards memorization undermines overall math success. Imagine a basketball coach telling his team, &#8220;To win games you need great defense and shooting&#8211;so stop learning how to dribble and pass.&#8221; That would make no sense. Great ball-handling only helps everything else you want to do in basketball, and automaticity only helps comprehension and problem-solving.</p>
<p>Sidenote: Just like in math, a basketball player absolutely needs to progress as quickly as possible from static dribbling drills to dynamic dribbling drills. And even static dribbling drills should be motivational and productive. But showering players with negativity towards drilling in general is going to undermine the overall skill, handicapping all their future success because they&#8217;ll constantly have to be thinking and looking at the ball, rather than their teammates or the hoop.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Research</strong><br />
NCTM, TEKS, Common Core, and The National Mathematics Advisory Panel, all agree that &#8220;<a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/report/final-report.pdf#page=47">curriculum must simultaneously</a> <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/report/final-report.pdf#page=47">develop conceptual understanding, computational fluency, and problem-solving </a><a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/report/final-report.pdf#page=47">skills</a>,&#8221; further clarifying that computational fluency means &#8220;<a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/report/final-report.pdf#page=14">automatic (i.e., quick</a> <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/report/final-report.pdf#page=14">and effortless) recall of facts</a>.&#8221; That&#8217;s memorization.</p>
<p>Furthermore, that same Final Report specifies that arguing about the relative merits of these different facets of math is &#8220;misguided&#8221; because &#8220;these capabilities are mutually supportive, each facilitating learning of the others.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Memorization Accelerates Comprehension and Problem-Solving</strong><br />
Students need number sense, comprehension, and application, and a child who enters fourth grade already automatic with core math facts is going to be able to develop these math concepts FASTER than a student who doesn&#8217;t. They will be more confident, but they will also have more available working memory.</p>
<p>Our own research confirms that memorization accelerates comprehension and problem-solving. Specifically, giving student populations the gift of automaticity catapults their year-end math scores. Fluency accelerates overall math learning because once they&#8217;re fluent, students permanently have more available working memory with which to learn new concepts and applications. If you&#8217;re going to chop down trees all day, please take a few minutes to sharpen the ax.</p>
<p><strong>Pressure<br />
</strong>I heard one educator lament that pressure can impede working memory so when a student most needs to recall a fact, they can&#8217;t and then they&#8217;re stuck. This misses the point. If the fact had been actually memorized, it wouldn&#8217;t have needed working memory. It would be effortless and automatic, even under duress. When core facts become trusted friends rather than distant memories, they are always available to help diminish stress AND free up precious working memory.</p>
<p>Of course they still need comprehension and application skills as well. They need all three.</p>
<p><strong>Robots<br />
</strong>I&#8217;ve heard some educators express concern that rote memorization is creating robots and therefore impeding the development of number sense. Not true. Phrases like &#8220;robots&#8221; and &#8220;drill and kill&#8221; have a nice, scary ring to them, but they imply a false principle. Mastering core skills does not in any way inhibit or undermine higher-order thinking. Quite the opposite, it liberates it. Freeing up working memory absolutely helps students be more successful at conceptual understanding and problem-solving. We&#8217;ve run tests where students master multiplication before learning ANY comprehension, and they still do significantly better when they are taught the comprehension.</p>
<p><strong>Pressure<br />
</strong>I&#8217;ve heard some educators complain that the pressure of memorization can give students a bad experience. So stop doing it badly and start doing it well! It&#8217;s not memorization that creates bad experiences any more than math instruction in general creates bad experiences. It&#8217;s bad instruction and bad memorization that create bad experiences. And be very aware that the frustration kids feel when they have to stop and think about every single basic calculation they encounter is always significant. You don&#8217;t remove that frustration simply by telling them it&#8217;s OK.</p>
<p><strong>Common Core Emphasis<br />
</strong>I&#8217;ve heard passionate educators exclaim that Common Core raises the priority of comprehension and application while lowering the emphasis on memorization. Absolutely false. Common Core significantly raised the priority of memorization, bumping it an entire grade earlier AND increasing the specificity of recalling facts &#8220;from memory.&#8221; Now, they ALSO raised and clarified the priority of comprehension and application . . . because all three are necessary and mutually beneficial.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Mutually Supportive<br />
</b></span>Once again, successful math students &#8220;must <strong>simultaneously</strong> develop conceptual understanding, computational fluency, <strong>and</strong> problem-solving skills.&#8221; &#8220;Debates regarding the relative importance of these aspects of mathematical knowledge are misguided&#8221; because &#8220;these capabilities are <strong>mutually supportive, each facilitating learning of the others.</strong>&#8221; [Final Report, 2008 emphasis added]</p>
<p><strong>Organic Automaticity<br />
</strong>Educators with a wonderful and valuable passion for number sense often express that the best way to develop automaticity is to simply use the facts regularly, combined with solid comprehension. I really like the sound of that, and I really wish it were true. But it&#8217;s not. It doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve worked with millions of students, and the majority of them will never develop automaticity with their core facts simply through continued usage and exposure. Some students will. And all students will master some. But most students at some point will need to buckle down and focus to become automatic with just their single digit facts.</p>
<p>However, they CAN acquire this precious skill in a matter of hours&#8211;at least with Big Brainz they can. EVERY student on earth should be given the precious few hours needed to acquire this precious skill and permanently expand their mathematical working memory.</p>
<p><strong>Ineffective Memorization</strong><br />
Wrapping up, let me also point out that it CAN be perfectly accurate to rant and rave against memorization IF you get just a bit more specific. Rant and rave against ineffective memorization&#8211;techniques that generate a negative experience and/or don&#8217;t actually generate fluency (which is most of them). Blast these traditional methods out of the water.</p>
<p><strong>Process Memorization<br />
</strong>You&#8217;re also welcome to rail against step-by-step process instruction that less effective teachers often fall into.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Change or Undermine Common Core or TEKS Requirement</strong><br />
But at the same time be very careful not to undermine the critical skill of automaticity. Be true to all the research behind the very specific common core requirement: &#8220;by the end of Grade 3, know from memory all products of two one-digit numbers.&#8221; Don&#8217;t undermine or change this requirement. And don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s importance is small just because it can be written concisely. The best scientific research in the world found that the #1 &#8220;Critical Foundation for Algebra&#8221; is whole-number fluency, the automatic and effortless recall of core facts, because it frees up working memory to focus on higher-order concepts and application. Give this precious gift to every single student.</p>
<p><strong>Sharpen the Saw<br />
</strong>Your students are going to be chopping away at comprehension and problem-solving 180 hours a year, every year. Give them the few hours needed (and a sufficiently powerful fluency program) to permanently sharpen their saw.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just stumbled across an article incorrectly stating that mastering multiplication tables is LESS important in the Common Core.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the article:<br />
<a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/2013/08/25/2724599/coaching-parents-students-through.html">http://www.idahostatesman.com/2013/08/25/2724599/coaching-parents-students-through.html</a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Common Core really says:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/3/OA/C/7">CCSS.Math.Content.3.OA.C.7</a> Fluently multiply and divide within 100, using strategies such as the relationship between multiplication and division (e.g., knowing that 8 × 5 = 40, one knows 40 ÷ 5 = 8) or properties of operations. <strong>By the end of Grade 3, know from memory all products of two one-digit numbers.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The more you care about developing higher-order mathematics, the more important fluency becomes&#8211;here&#8217;s the comment I left:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s completely incorrect to state or imply that Common Core does not stress or require basic fact memorization. In truth, Common Core actually elevates the priority of automatic recall&#8211;now requiring automatic recall by the end of grade 3. Automaticity is obviously not the end goal of mathematics, but it IS a critical step.</p>
<p>This is a critical clarification because massive research shows that the average student was already failing at fluency in Idaho (and everywhere else in the country). Anything making it an even lower priority will only exacerbate the problem of trying to teach algebra to 7th-graders who have to stop every 5 seconds to calculate 6&#215;8.</p>
<p>Understanding and strategy are partners with fluency&#8211;not enemies. Implying otherwise is like saying that you&#8217;re going to win football games by tossing out the offensive line so that the quarterback has more room to maneuver. They may not be sexy, but they win games.</p>
<p>Automaticity doesn&#8217;t impede or detract from strategy and understanding&#8211;on the contrary it helps it enormously. The real problem with fluency is that most teachers are still using primitive tools, spending 15 to 30 hours, only to average 59% fluency by 5th-grade. That means they&#8217;re spending too many precious hours without even getting to the finish line!</p>
<p>This drives us crazy because as experts in fact fluency, our average 3rd-grader masters fluency in 4.6 hours and tests above 95%. Don&#8217;t toss fluency, but do toss stone age tools like flash cards, flash games, and worksheets. I&#8217;d rather not even mention our product&#8217;s name because I don&#8217;t want this to be self-serving. I&#8217;d rather focus on the key point that total fluency is critical, and it&#8217;s quite speedy and guaranteed if you just stop and Google a truly powerful solution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Multiplication worksheets are the most common way that schools measure math fact fluency, yet aggregating response times from so many different facts rarely tells you which ones a student is actually fluent with and which ones they are still calculating.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for maximizing your effectiveness:</p>
<p>1. Assess each individual fact. You can use a stopwatch or let a program like Timez Attack do it for you automatically, but at some point it&#8217;s critical to measure which facts they can recall automatically and which ones they have to stop and calculate. If you don&#8217;t measure it accurately, you won&#8217;t fix it.</p>
<p>2. For your reference, fluent students generally recall AND input a 2-digit response in 1.9 seconds with a standard deviation of .6 seconds. Verbal responses would typically need just 1 second. A fluent student is automatic, but they are also <strong>confident</strong>. It&#8217;s empowering and motivational to KNOW the answer, so don&#8217;t shortchange students by settling for fumbled answers.</p>
<p>3. Report the results and do it as a letter grade. Few educators or parents will ignore a student that is clearly failing, yet the majority of students today currently have an &#8220;F&#8221; in fluency, yet they are promoted without a second thought because the shortcoming is only vaguely discovered and reported&#8211;if it&#8217;s discovered or reported at all.</p>
<p>4. If you have to use worksheets for assessment for some reason, at least do it in smaller chunks or lock down the average time. 2 seconds per fact will always be a fairly certain demonstration of fluency and 2.5 to 3 seconds per fact for 10 to 12 facts at a time will do a decent job. But if you gave an average student three minutes to answer 60 facts, they would answer the easy half in 1.5 to 2 seconds each, but then take 3 to 8 seconds to calculate others, giving only the illusion of fluency.</p>
<p>5. Don&#8217;t settle. Fluency is a core skill, yet the average student today plateaus in the 5th-grade with just 59% mastery&#8211;essentially the easy facts. Would you promote a student that had only learned 59% of the alphabet? Timez Attack delivers 95% fluency in a matter of hours, so there&#8217;s no need to handicap students for the rest of their math careers.</p>
<p>6. Finally, don&#8217;t assume that student fluency will magically improve &#8220;somehow&#8221; after they leave your class. Adopt the attitude, &#8220;If I send a student out the door with poor fluency, I&#8217;m likely ensuring they will struggle with math for the rest of their life.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll wrap up with some general advice. Learning multiplication is hard, so block out the time for it. But it&#8217;s also completely doable, so don&#8217;t let failure be an option. Timez Attack can knock it out easily for you in a matter of hours. No worries if you prefer a different way but whichever path you choose, make sure your students cross the finish line.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Division-Games.php">Division games</a> have never been in super high demand.  In fact, the only time we&#8217;ve ever really been asked about division is when folks are asking if we cover &#8220;all four&#8221; operations. However, once we finally finished our division expansion pack we discovered something very interesting. Well, first we realized that it&#8217;s hard. We&#8217;ve been focused on multiplication for so long that, well, we&#8217;re REALLY good at it.  But even though division is really the same thing in reverse, it&#8217;s surprisingly different.  It&#8217;s sort of like learning to make a lay-up with your left hand instead of your right.</p>
<p>But the main thing we learned is that <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Division-Games.php">division games</a> significantly deepened and solidified our math awareness. Understanding how the fact operations work, both forward AND backwards, really pounds them home and gives you a more solid understanding.  With students, we also found that moving on to a powerful division experience after mastering multiplication ensured that the multiplication mastery all stayed nice and solid.</p>
<p>In the end, we figure that mastering division in addition to multiplication will help students comprehend division concepts better all around, but it will also accelerate all of their calculations by a few seconds.  This will let them save an enormous amount of time over the next many years.  But more importantly, getting the basic calculations out of the way will enable them to focus and master higher order concepts much more effectively in the coming years.</p>
<p>So . . . three cheers for Division&#8211;the black sheep of the fact family!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Savvy educators regularly ask us if our <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Articles/Multiplication-Games.html">multiplication games</a> are research-based.  On the surface that sounds like an important question.  But in reality it’s essentially meaningless.  In the researching world there’s the common expression that “there are lies, damn lies, and statistics.”  In other words, knowing that there was some research associated with a product really doesn’t tell you anything.  Maybe the research was lousy.  Maybe the research showed the product was lame.  In either case the manufacturer could still claim it to be research-based.  Even worse, research on a poor product can easily be presented in such a way that it SEEMS amazing.</p>
<p>For instance, in one of the <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Articles/Multiplication-Games.html">multiplication games</a> we came across, their research was from 30 years ago!  That’s ancient history, not research.  How big was the sample size?  How was it controlled and administered, etc?  But how many educators really have the training, background, and time to ask and evaluate all those questions?  Very few.  And so they wind up asking, “Is it research-based?”  Check.  And they move on.</p>
<p>So is there a solution or are we just being armchair quarterbacks taking shots from the cheap seats?  Well, for our <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Articles/Multiplication-Games.html">multiplication games</a> we took the perspective of Derrin Hill of <a href="http://www.imaginelearning.com/">Imagine Learning</a>.  He explained to me that when he’s considering a vendor he always challenges them, “Prove to me it’s worth it.”  For instance, if a magazine wants him to advertise he requires them to first run a trackable ad and then he measure the results.  If it PROVES effective, he moves forward.</p>
<p>Accordingly, if a school wants to use our <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Articles/Multiplication-Games.html">multiplication games</a>, we might allow them to pilot the software with an included pre-test and post-test so that they can automatically quantify how effective it is for their students.  It’s a very simple way for them to prove how effectively Timez Attack teaches <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Multiplication.php">multiplication</a>.  The indirect bonus of that approach is that it provides a massive amount of detailed feedback for the developer, allowing them to very clearly see where they’re falling short and improve their product.  It’s tantalizing to imagine a day when  schools will pay for actual learning and progress rather than just paying for the hope and promise of learning.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lots of folks have kicked around the idea of iPads replacing <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/california-schools-replace-math-textbooks-with-ipads/58416"> textbooks</a> or <a href="http://wirededucator.wordpress.com/2010/04/15/an-ipad-in-every-classroom-teacher-tested-student-approved/">laptops</a> in school classrooms, but I think both discussions are missing the real value of an iPad or tablet in a classroom—the input.  The key stumbling block for software instruction is input.  Humans are vastly better at understanding what children know and what they don’t know than computers are.  Humans can gauge student mastery by listening to what they say, by reading what they write, or simply by looking at the expression on their face.</p>
<p>Well, throw in a little voice-command, some handwriting recognition, and add a camera with “confusion detection” rather than “smile detection” and you’ve made digital education vastly more realistic.  A little too Buck Rogers?  Today, maybe.  But give it a few more years.</p>
<p>In the short-term, I’m most excited about the immediate benefits for math.  If a student does their math homework on an iPad, an awesome algebra app could follow along with HOW they’re solving the problem and show them exactly where in the process they may have messed up and instantly link them to the correction and instruction they need to keep working towards mastery.  I think iPads and tablets open the door for us to teach complex math subjects, like algebra, as effectively as games like Timez Attack teach <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Multiplication.php">multiplication</a>.</p>
<p>What do you think—doable?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Multiplication" href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Multiplication.php" target="_blank">Multiplication</a> games will save the world.  Well, not JUST <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Multiplication.php">multiplication games</a>, but educational games in general.  Remember that scene from <em>The Matrix</em> where <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AOpomu9V6Q" target="_blank">Trinity learns how to fly a helicopter</a> in 5 seconds flat by using a perfect virtual simulator?  Well, it might take more than 5 seconds, but the technology for teaching people in such an immersive, effective environment already exists—we just don’t take advantage of it.</p>
<p>As a civilization, we’ll spend billions and billions to immerse kids in all kinds of unbelievably elaborate environments with no purpose whatsoever.  Just imagine what would happen if we invested a billion dollars into the world’s greatest math game instead of Grand Theft Auto.  Instead of accomplishing diddly-squat , we would have created a nation of kids who know math!  Millions of kids could be significantly smarter and more confident.  We have the technology.  We’re already spending the dollars.  We just need to redirect it into more beneficial products.</p>
<p>“Can’t be done,” some people will say.  Ridiculous.  We’ve already proved it can be done with our multiplication game, Timez Attack.  It takes time and effort, but obviously you can make an educational game just as engaging as an entertainment-only game if you really want to.  In fact, educational games can be even more entertaining because they include real achievement.  Think about it&#8211;as enjoyable as Madden NFL is, it’s still not as entertaining as the real thing.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t buy that argument, educational games have another built-in advantage.  The kids already HAVE  to learn this stuff.  They can either do it in a boring, painful, old-school way, or they can do it in a high-end, world-class video game.  The “shooting fish in a barrel” analogy comes to mind when you think about such an easy decision.</p>
<p>So what’s stopping us?  Well, there’s the “Edutainment” cynicism accumulated from a generation or two of pathetic educational software, parental apathy, the fragmented nature of the school system, and the decidedly low-tech culture at the huge educational publishing houses.  But in the end, it’s just dollars.  The gaming industry just needs to realize what a massive, untapped market educational games represent.  Once they realize what a gold mine they’re sitting on, we’ll finally see an educational revolution equal in scope to the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>It’s going to happen sooner or later.  Let’s get with the program and make it sooner.</p>
