				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m intrigued by the negative responses to the Common Core standards. The opposition is so passionate that often their arguments explode in a flaming ball of general vitriol that makes it hard to see what specific aspects they&#8217;re opposed to. So, in an attempt to engender productive discussion, here here is my attempt to present Common Core concerns simply and clearly.</p>
<p>Inherent in my approach is the assumption that in the grand scheme of things everyone&#8217;s actually on the same side&#8211;the kids&#8217; side. And our kids will be better served when everyone stops fighting and instead works together productively to find common ground. (pardon the pun and cue the sappy music for group hug)</p>
<p>Please jump in to clarify or add concerns, and I will edit accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Undermines Freedom</strong><br />
Many folks see the standards as federal control and they hate being constrained and dictated to by The Man.</p>
<p><strong>Poor Implementation</strong><br />
In many cases, efforts to address the standards have been inept or offensive.</p>
<p><strong>Inflexible</strong><br />
The standards are too high for struggling students or populations, so individual states, districts, and schools would like more flexibility to lower them. Others think the standards are too low.</p>
<p><strong>Testing Pressure</strong><br />
Clear cut standards could create greater pressure on performance. This pressure could tempt teachers to try &#8220;teaching to the test,&#8221; even though such methods generate worse test results<a href="http://www.readingrockets.org/article/teach-test-just-say-no" target="_blank">*</a>. Performance pressure could also prompt additional testing throughout the year, which would detract from instructional time.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><br />
The standards were not created in an ideal way, using ANSI guidelines for example. It&#8217;s costly to implement new standards. They might track too much information about students.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2011 Andrea Kuszewski wrote a great article about how we can increase our intelligence: <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/03/07/you-can-increase-your-intelligence-5-ways-to-maximize-your-cognitive-potential/">http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/03/07/you-can-increase-your-intelligence-5-ways-to-maximize-your-cognitive-potential/</a></p>
<p>My metaphor for what Andrea said would be: cross-training. If you&#8217;re constantly pushing your body (or mind) in new and challenging ways, it will continue to strengthen and improve. Once it gets used to a certain activity, it stops building new muscle and can actually decline as it gets more efficient.</p>
<p>Big Brainz happens to fulfill most of the applicable steps for expanding your intelligence, and the key tie-in for me, was the fact that increasing your mental capacity in one area, allows you to be more capable in other areas.</p>
<p>The cross-training metaphor kicks in again&#8211;getting good at any sport will have a positive effect in other sports. In education that would imply that mastering  your multiplication facts with Big Brainz would likely make you a better reader.</p>
<p>What we have actually found is that mastering multiplication has a disproportionately positive impact on everything a student does because it significantly boosts the students&#8217; confidence and work ethic. Sure, by simply mastering core multiplication facts, the student has removed the most prolific stumbling block in math. But they&#8217;ve also removed a giant billboard from their life that was constantly telling them &#8220;You&#8217;re stupid,&#8221; or &#8220;You&#8217;re no good at math.&#8221;</p>
<p>By conquering the ubiquitous challenge of fact fluency, they&#8217;ve chopped that sign down and burned it, replacing it with a sign that constantly tells them, &#8220;Wow, you NAILED that really hard thing. You&#8217;re wicked smart! With a little elbow grease, you can do anything!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Transforming students from discouraged to flourishing&#8211;THAT is why we do what we do here at Big Brainz.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lack of Assessment and Reporting.</p>
<p>Fact fluency is not directly measured in end-of-year testing. Schools tease at assessment with worksheets and games, but they never get in and find out which facts students can recall automatically and which ones they can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Principals and teachers aren&#8217;t eager to promote failing students, but because the depth of failure is not clearly reported in black and white, the problem is easily swept under the rug.</p>
<p>If schools published a letter grade for the math fluency of each class, we would see an instant and dramatic improvement. Few educators would be willing to tolerate an average grade of &#8220;F&#8221; for their classes, but with fact fluency they do tolerate across-the-board failure because they never really know that&#8217;s how bad their students are doing.</p>
<p>Math fact fluency is easily the most un-diagnosed cause of overall math failure later in life, and could be quickly remedied if it were simply assessed and reported.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inefficient Instruction.</p>
<p>If you read Part 1, you know that mastering multiplication is hard. But it&#8217;s not impossible, right? I mean any decent educator with a deck of flash cards can whip just about any student in to shape eventually, right?</p>
<p>But teachers rarely get to teach 1-on-1 and when they switch to teaching large groups, their instruction has to generalize. They turn to worksheets, random multiplication games, or flash cards. However, all of these methods lack the benefits that intelligent instruction can provide.</p>
<p>Specifically, worksheets, flash cards, and most games aren&#8217;t able to prioritize fact presentation based on how well the student knows each individual fact. And second, they aren&#8217;t able to be strategic in how they move knowledge form short-term to long-term memory.</p>
<p>Random drill and kill&#8211;a surefire recipe for failure.</p>

<p>Even Timez Attack requires a significant amount of effort. It&#8217;s fun and rewarding, but it&#8217;s active engagement. And folks today favor passive engagement like watching TV, playing casual games, or clicking &#8220;Like&#8221; on Facebook.</p>
<p>I guess this is kind of a short post, but in the end, effort really is the only real reason a child doesn&#8217;t master their multiplication tables. I&#8217;ll start giving more practical solutions in the next segment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was in a serious discussion with the head of one of the two largest educational publishers about the incredible possibilities that high-end educational software could offer students.  I pressed him to explain why everyone in educational software kept cranking out primitive games instead.  His seasoned response?  Kids are already so bored in school that by comparison, just a little bit of entertainment is enough.</p>
<p>In other words, if you&#8217;re starving, a crust of bread is a feast.  Why waste money on steak? Or more generously, if a baloney sandwich will do, why prepare a feast?</p>
<p>So when is good good enough? Let&#8217;s use multiplication tables as an example. Are Flash cards good enough? They&#8217;re cheap. If you invest the time, they work. Why do anything else? So maybe you&#8217;re more motivated than that and you make a little flash game that teaches multiplication. Maybe you go the extra mile and have it track their work and generate reports?  While you&#8217;re at it, why not Google someone&#8217;s thesis from the 80&#8217;s so you can call it &#8220;Research-Based&#8221; and charge a lot of money for it.  That&#8217;s basically as far as anyone gets.  So why in the world would anyone choose to invest millions and millions of dollars over years and years, when viable alternatives are so cheap and easy?</p>
<p>Our answer is that cheap, primitive solutions aren&#8217;t good enough because &#8220;good enough&#8221; can be easily quantified and our students are failing.  Only about 1/3 of students in the US are considered Proficient in math. Period. That really ought to immediately end any speculation over whether our current efforts are good enough.</p>
<p>Once every student is achieving needed levels of mastery in the needed time period . . . THEN we can start arguing about whether they&#8217;re having too much fun along the way. Until then, can we as an industry please pull our head out of the sand and stop flooding the world with primitive educational software that simply doesn&#8217;t do the job?</p>
<p>Now, I understand the complaints about that philosophy myself. &#8220;Hey, the software we already have DOES the job. It&#8217;s just insanely hard to get schools to realize that and use it.&#8221; Yes, schools are unbelievably fragmented, politically divisive, cash-strapped, and justifiably cynical about educational software. You would truly have to be stupendous in ways as-yet-unimagined to cut through all that friction.</p>
<p>So do it. Create programs that aren&#8217;t just well-intentioned, evolutionary improvements. Break all the rules. Invest a billion dollars in Algebra and change the world forever. Billion sounds like a big number, but over 10 years that amortizes down to just $25 per student. And that&#8217;s just in the US.  Spread that across the globe and it&#8217;s practically free. Do you think districts would pay a few bucks to yank all of their students up to Proficient in Algebra? Uhh . . . duh! You&#8217;d make a fortune and you&#8217;d be saving the world at the same time.</p>
<p>So to summarize then, can we please all settle in on the fact that whatever you&#8217;re doing, however you&#8217;re doing it, we need to massively improve our education technology. Children are still getting left behind. Only a handful are getting ahead. We have the technology to fix it and we have the capital. We just don&#8217;t demand it. We&#8217;re settling for a crust of bread when we could have a feast.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Savvy educators regularly ask us if our <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Articles/Multiplication-Games.html">multiplication games</a> are research-based.  On the surface that sounds like an important question.  But in reality it’s essentially meaningless.  In the researching world there’s the common expression that “there are lies, damn lies, and statistics.”  In other words, knowing that there was some research associated with a product really doesn’t tell you anything.  Maybe the research was lousy.  Maybe the research showed the product was lame.  In either case the manufacturer could still claim it to be research-based.  Even worse, research on a poor product can easily be presented in such a way that it SEEMS amazing.</p>
<p>For instance, in one of the <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Articles/Multiplication-Games.html">multiplication games</a> we came across, their research was from 30 years ago!  That’s ancient history, not research.  How big was the sample size?  How was it controlled and administered, etc?  But how many educators really have the training, background, and time to ask and evaluate all those questions?  Very few.  And so they wind up asking, “Is it research-based?”  Check.  And they move on.</p>
<p>So is there a solution or are we just being armchair quarterbacks taking shots from the cheap seats?  Well, for our <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Articles/Multiplication-Games.html">multiplication games</a> we took the perspective of Derrin Hill of <a href="http://www.imaginelearning.com/">Imagine Learning</a>.  He explained to me that when he’s considering a vendor he always challenges them, “Prove to me it’s worth it.”  For instance, if a magazine wants him to advertise he requires them to first run a trackable ad and then he measure the results.  If it PROVES effective, he moves forward.</p>
<p>Accordingly, if a school wants to use our <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Articles/Multiplication-Games.html">multiplication games</a>, we might allow them to pilot the software with an included pre-test and post-test so that they can automatically quantify how effective it is for their students.  It’s a very simple way for them to prove how effectively Timez Attack teaches <a href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Multiplication.php">multiplication</a>.  The indirect bonus of that approach is that it provides a massive amount of detailed feedback for the developer, allowing them to very clearly see where they’re falling short and improve their product.  It’s tantalizing to imagine a day when  schools will pay for actual learning and progress rather than just paying for the hope and promise of learning.</p>
