<P align=left>  I thought I would shoot you the answers to a few common questions I often get&nbsp;about Timez Attack and Multiplication Mastery:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<DIV align=left><STRONG>How long does it usually take a child to finish?</STRONG><BR><BR>We've tested&nbsp;pre-3rd graders&nbsp;for an hour a day for 9 days.&nbsp; 50% of them passed off all the levels, 33% were on the 9's, and 16% were struggling down in the 4's.<BR><BR></DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV align=left><STRONG>What can I do to help my child progress even faster?</STRONG><BR><BR>Ok, it's a shameless plug, but if you can afford the full version, the additional environments will really help a lot.&nbsp; In addition to that,&nbsp;taking time to pin down some concrete goals really does work wonders.&nbsp; If all else fails, there's always good old-fashioned bribery.<BR><BR></DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV align=left><STRONG>Do children need anything besides Timez Attack?</STRONG><BR><BR>Definitely.&nbsp; Timez Attack is exceptionally good at teaching children total mastery of the multiplication tables, but it's still vital that children learn how to apply and manipulate all those facts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure they get&nbsp;ample opportunity to move all that monitor/keyboard knowledge over to pencil/paper answers.<BR></DIV></LI></OL>
<P align=left>If you have a question I haven't answered, please just let me know.&nbsp; And a big&nbsp;thanks to all of you who are helpling spread the word with your emails and links--every little bit helps!<BR><BR>Take care,<BR><BR>Ben Harrison<BR>President<BR>877 356-7040<BR><A href="http://www.bigbrainz.com/">www.bigbrainz.com</A><BR><IMG src="http://www.bigbrainz.com/Assets/Images/BigBrainzLogo60.jpg" width="145" height="60"><BR>
