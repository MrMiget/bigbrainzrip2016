            As an educator I am always searching for new ways in which to get my students involved with learning in a way that engages them. Timez Attack does just this. With unbelievable graphics and challenging levels, the students don&#039;t feel that they are practicing times tables, they are playing a game. This is by far the best multiplication practice software I have ever seen. I will ensure that each of my students has access to it!

            My 15 year old son is on the autism spectrum. It is always a challenge to find something that engages him to learn.  We had tried many things before to get him to remember his multiplication tables.  Timez-Attack caught his attention right away.  He loves the challenges and will play for 30 minutes without me bothering him to do more.  He wants to get the answers right so he can move on to the next level and loves the animations!

            I have been working with my LD daughter on just addition facts, and she is going into 4th grade next year. (Of course we&#039;ve done the other functions too!) Without fast recall of basic math facts, she just couldn&#039;t keep up. I was searching for a &quot;multiplication facts song&quot; (she loves music) and saw your link. We were both prepared for another bland experience, but Oh My Flying Spaghetti Monster! This has been the turning point I was looking for. I just can&#039;t think you and your cohorts enough for this game.
THANK YOU!

            My daughter was 2 grade levels behind in math when I began homeschooling her a year age. She was 1/2 way through the 5th grade and still did not know all of her addition and subtraction, let alone her multiplication and division facts. Timez-Attack has been a tremendous help in helping her get caught up in her learning. 
 
I have told other homeschooling moms about Timez-Attack and we will continue to utilize this resource.

            We are Americans living in a developing nation in Asia. Our 5th-grade daughter has attended the local schools until this year,when we felt the need to provide her with a better education. I found a number of &quot;holes&quot; in her educational foundation, which we have been working to shore up. One of them was definitely in the area of math, specifically her multiplication tables. She had become frustrated and convinced that she could not learn the multiplication facts. Practice was emotionally draining for both of us. Then, we bought Big Brainz Timez-Attack. What a difference! She looks forward to her multiplication practice every day with this program, and we&#039;ve seen real improvements in a matter of weeks. Her sisters love to watch her play &amp; are looking forward to the time when they can use it, too. She&#039;s learning; we&#039;re both happier, and I&#039;m thrilled that such a product exists!

            I have been trying to get my boys to do 100 problems of addition and subtraction in under 5 minutes for a couple years. We used this program and within a couple of weeks, we had changed our times from 8 to 9 minutes to under 5 minutes. They found satisfaction in beating the levels and I&#039;m very happy with this product.

            I am the Principal of a low performing Title 1 school.  We have a tremendous need for remediation.  On basic math skills we use Big Brainz.   Our kids and teachers love it. We use it from Kindergarten through 5th grade. Engagement is out of this world and the students are soaring.  In the math field Big Brainz will be the program that has the greatest impact on our students success in math.  I tell everyone I know to get it.

            Timez-Attack was first recommended by my sister who is a teacher specialized with learning disabilities. My daughter has always struggled with math and resented practice drill of any sort.  We did not tell her it was a math practice game. She fell in love with it and always wants to play. It is a very engaging and encouraging game.  It really helped her to memorize her times table. Once told the purpose of the game, she simply said that it didn&#039;t feel like school work. This is by far the best math practice program we have used.

            Big Brainz created a hit!  I home school my 9 children and this has literally made a game of the most frustrating part of math fundamentals. I have to force my kids to shut it down! My kids all love it. My oldest daughter (14) mastered it but still likes to play once in a while!(I would love to see a higher level math game for her(hint))  My 8 year old (thanks to Big Brainz) has mastered multiplication and division and loves math!

I actually called to offer them more money! (They asked me for a review instead!)

Thank you so much for a great product and the hard work that it took to make your vision a reality for all of the parents out there that know the pain of repetitious memory work!

            Hi! I just wanted to thank the creators of this game for making such a wonderful learning tool.

I homeschool my two boys, ages 7 (2nd grade) and 4 (pre-k but academically 1st/2nd grade). My boys LOVE your game! They both mastered addition in a little less than two weeks (the biggest obstacle was learning 10 key at first), improving their addition facts from 43% - 96% and 35% - 98%, respectively.  My oldest lost interest in the subtraction level after a few days, but my 4 year old continued on, completing and improving his subtraction facts at over 200%. Then they both asked me to teach them multiplication so they could do that level. After my initial multiplication introduction, they both took off....and 10 days later, my 4 year old (he will be 5 next month) completed his multiplication facts! He went from 4% to 96%...in 10 days....he&#039;s 4! And now he&#039;s on to division....at age 4...thanks to your game! My 7 year old should complete multiplication soon, and is having such a great time with your game.

Thank you again for your creative learning tool! I wish I&#039;d have had something like this to learn math facts when I was young...sure beats the heck out of flash cards.

            &quot;I love this game! I bought the 90 day trial for my 5 year old because he was expressing interest in math. He likes it because he feels like he&#039;s playing a video game, and I&#039;m impressed at how quickly he can do math in his head now. I like that the game continues to assess his progress and allows him to see what he has mastered as well as what he needs to work on. At first he was frustrated because the game is fast-paced, but now that he has mastered the keypad that&#039;s no longer an issue. I would highly recommend this for any child because it makes learning fun, especially those boring multiplication problems.

            I highly recommend Timez-Attack for retention of math facts. My son was struggling with multiplication, but within two weeks of playing Timez-Attack, for 15 minutes a day, he has conquered his obstacles.  He actually insists on playing the game ever day!  Music to my ears. It was one of the best investments I have made for his education!
