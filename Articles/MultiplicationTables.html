<p class="text">Mastering multiplication Tables is a critical turning point in
  a child's education.&nbsp; Because math builds on itself, a failure to master
  the multiplication tables will keep them from conquering all their future mathematic
  challenges.&nbsp;Without these core math skills, children will quickly fall
  behind, causing them to permanently label themselves as &quot;bad at math&quot; or decide
  they &quot;hate math.&quot;</p>
<p class="text">The problem, of course, is that multiplication tables are tough.&nbsp;Very
  tough.&nbsp; And the tools we get to tackle this challenge are extremely ineffective.&nbsp; The
  most effective tool is still a plain old deck of flash cards.&nbsp; Night after
  night after night.&nbsp; Flash cards can teach multiplication tables, but few
  parents or children have the patience and desire to keep banging away on something
  so boring for weeks on end. </p>
<p class="text">The obvious alternative is a multiplication tables game--that's
  why there are hundreds of them.&nbsp; The problem with multiplication table
  games  is that they're usually ineffective, boring, or both.&nbsp; Many
  a parent has plunked down their good hard cash at a major retailer for some
  multiplication game that turned out to be a huge waste of money.&nbsp; Some
  parents then have turned to word-association methods, while others have simply
  given up altogether. </p>
<p class="text">The purpose of this page is to pull together a list of genuinely
  effective tools and advice for truly mastering multiplication tables.&nbsp; </p>
